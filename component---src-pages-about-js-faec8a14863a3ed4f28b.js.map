My name is Keith\n        Choa, and I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of\n        Waterloo. I have a keen interest in embedded development, but as a\n        natural learner, I'm always up for a challenge (thus, why I've set up\n        this wonderful site)!\n      </p>\n      <h1>What is this?</h1>\n      <p>\n        As someone new to web development in general, this is my playground to\n        test new ideas and to play around with various tech stacks. Currently,\n        this website is built off of Gatsby.js, which works off of React.js\n        components, and a node.js package management system (npm).\n        <br></br>\n        <br></br>\n        As I mentioned, this is sort of my playground, so expect to see many\n        changes as time goes on. From UI overhauls, to changes in my tech stack,\n        I have a lot planned for this site. So, if you're interested, stay\n        tuned! I like to keep track of my progress in my blog section of this\n        site.\n      </p>\n      <h1>How can I contact you?</h1>\n      <p>\n        I'm currently looking for Fall 2020 Co-op Opportunities, so if you have\n        a position open, I'd be happy to get in contact. Regardless of that, if\n        you have any questions about embedded development, my life at Waterloo,\n        or anything in general, feel free to contact me at any of the links\n        below. Look forward to talking to you soon!\n        <br></br>\n        <br></br>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithchoa/\">My Linkedin</a>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"https://devpost.com/Cookieth\">My Devpost</a>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </p>\n      <Bio />\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default LandingPage\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
